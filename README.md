# Game Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on analyzing mobile games. The project aims to gain insights into the revenue, time of release, publishers, and genres of various mobile games. The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is named "mobile-games.csv" and is available for download from Kaggle. It contains information about 104 mobile games, including the game title, revenue, release date, publisher, and genre(s). The dataset provides a snapshot of the mobile gaming industry and can be used to analyze trends, patterns, and relationships between different game attributes.

You can download the dataset from the following Kaggle page:

## Project Overview

The Game Analysis project includes the following steps and analyses:

1. Data Loading: The project starts by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

2. Data Exploration: Various pandas functions are used to explore the dataset, including examining the shape of the data (number of rows and columns), displaying the column names, and previewing the first and last few records of the dataset.

3. Data Cleaning: If required, data cleaning steps such as handling missing values, converting data types, or preprocessing the data can be performed to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

4. Data Analysis: The project involves performing various analyses on the dataset, including descriptive statistics, grouping and aggregation, data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn, and exploring relationships between different variables.

5. Insights and Reporting: The findings and insights obtained from the analysis are summarized and presented using visualizations, reports, or interactive dashboards. These outputs help in understanding the mobile gaming industry, revenue patterns, popular genres, and the impact of publishers.
